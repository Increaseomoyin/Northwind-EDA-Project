# Northwind-EDA-Project

## Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the sales performance of a production company over the past years. By analyzing various aspects of the sales data, I seek to identify trends and make data-driven recommendations.

### Data Sources

NorthWind Data: I got this database "NorthWind.txt" from a fellow Data Analyst and Content Creator, after I requested for it through mail.

### Tools
-SQL Server- Importing database and Analysis

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

The data was already clean and ready for analysis, although I did some checks on the data to confirm this.

### Exploatory Data Analysis

The main focus of this product was to carry out EDA on this dataset using SQL to answer up to 80 business-based questions contained in a seperate file "NorthWind Mar.pdf". Some of the questions includes:

-What is the name of the company that supplied the product with ProductID 1?

-What is the name of the contact person for the customer with CustomerID ANATR?

-What are the names of all the employees who have sold products to customers in Germany?

-What are the names of all the employees who have sold products to customers in the year
1996?

### Results/Findings

Leveraging advanced skills in SQL, I was able to write queries that answered most of the business questions. The SQL file "NorthWind Database(EDA) is contained in this Repository

### Limitations

This project tested my in-depth knowledge of SQL advanced queries and how to apply them in answering questions. I had to consult ChatGBT to help process some of the queries.
